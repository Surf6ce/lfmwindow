## Build

None currently. This is a hogepodge personal project and this repo serves as a public mirror... for now


## Roadmap ig

- hopefully use some album art correction system or better fetching. 
- add alternative styling options inspired by different music apps. 
- Lyric and syncing? (this would require spotify api/cider api to get needed info.)
